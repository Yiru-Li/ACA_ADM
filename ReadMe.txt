Since I’m not allowed to upload file larger than 25 MB, I cannot upload the head model. If you need the head model, please find it in my google drive (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p4_4cKjSDo5sE--eamYbI-LI23XCYgId/view?usp=share_link).

I also uploaded all files related to the paper to drive. If you’re interested, please find them here (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BzB3Yr04wPgQikqeIsLHbwzyMKhmopVK/view?usp=share_link). 

I suggest you first download the basic code and head model, in which ‘ACA_ADM_DiffCtr_DiffRad_main.m’ is the main code. Since different Coil position and different ROI radius are considered in the code, you may need to choose the specific coil  position and ROI size you would like to use.
